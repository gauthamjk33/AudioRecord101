*Real-time Audio Recorder with Notifications*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Current Features]

-[Real-time Audio Recording]: The script captures audio from the default playback device hands free and saves it as '.wav' files in the specified output folder. The audio is recorded in a loop, overwriting the current file with each iteration.

-[Status Notifications]: The program sends the following toast notifications to keep the user informed about the recording/app process:

	-"Recording in progress" when recording starts.
	-"Recording loop count" Loop 1,2 and so on.
	-"Recording process paused" when the user pauses recording.
	-"Recording process resumed" when the user resumes recording.
	-"Recording has ended" when the user stops the recording.
	-"App closed" Code exists successfully with exit code 0.

-[Looped Recording]: This application features looped recording, where it repeatedly records and overwrites the same file, making it useful for scenarios where you need the most 	recent 	audio data continuously. (New addition)

-[Timer and Date/Time Display]: The application displays the elapsed time and current date/time while it is running.

-[Code Comments]: The code is extensively documented with comments, explaining its functionality and structure for better understanding and potential modifications.
